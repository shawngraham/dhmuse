      <description>You did it!.
  Ave atque Vale I wrote this out and managed to delete everything I had already written. D&amp;rsquo;oh.This is my second try.
Cast your mind back to our first meeting, in January. That day, I had received some bad news concerning the health of a friend of mine. I was pretty flat, and did a poor job in class. I told you about it, later, and said something like, &amp;lsquo;y&amp;rsquo;know, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing we can&amp;rsquo;t roll with in this course, as long as we&amp;rsquo;re talking&amp;rsquo;.</description>

  Online Slidedecks Slidedecks or presentations don&amp;rsquo;t have to be complex. You can make them using nothing but a text file. There are a lot of advantages to doing things this way, but what I really like is that it makes sharing slides super easy - no downloads, no stupid Microsoft Powerpoint faffing around.</description>

      <title>So What Can You Do With an API Anyway?</title>

      <description>At this point in the class, you&amp;rsquo;ve started wrestling and wrangling the physical records describing some of the materials in our three partner museums. You&amp;rsquo;re thinking through how to digitize this material - or you should be, make sure to read the relevant how-tos! - and how to organize it into a flat table. You have guidance on how to publish this data online. But&amp;hellip; you might be quietly worried about what one does with such data, once it&amp;rsquo;s online.</description>

  Our end goal - or one of our end goals - is to get the material out of the museum, out of the printed page, and online where someone can query it, filter it, extract items of interest, mash it together with other data, or something else entirely that we haven&amp;rsquo;t thought of yet.</description>

      <description>The point of keeping a running diary-journal-devlog is to have a single point where you can see your evolution over this course. It&amp;rsquo;s a place to tie your readings to the discussions to the hands-on nuts-and-bolts of doing informatics work. It&amp;rsquo;s a place to leave notes to &amp;lsquo;future you&amp;rsquo; so that when you walk away from the machine, you can pick up where you were again.
It&amp;rsquo;s also a place for you to see what your peers are up to, their successes, and their roadblocks.</description>

      <guid>https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/getting-started-with-tropy/</guid>
      <description>Tropy is quite new software meant to help researchers make sense of their research photography. I do not have deep experience with it - yet. But one thing that I am good at (actually, something I quite like to do), is figuring out how to get software, programmes, code working, and getting it to do things that its creators might not necessarily have imagined.
On the other hand, this means that I sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t spell out all of the steps, or I forget which bits of my process are tacit and need to be made explicit when people are starting out.</description>

  What are student hours for? You will be familiar with the idea of &amp;lsquo;office hours&amp;rsquo;, those magical moments where a prof deigns to make themself available by sitting in their cell up along the quiet corridors of the 4th floor of Paterson.</description>

      <description>Matthew Lincoln is a research software engineer at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries. He is currently working on a book using data-driven approaches to understanding the art market and collecting histories. You should really keep an eye on his blog if you want to get a look at what&amp;rsquo;s happening today at the intersection of digital techs and the GLAM sector.
On December 17 he published an article, &amp;ldquo;Tips for a Good Hackathon&amp;rdquo; that I think it is worth your while to read, since some of the things that make for a good hackathon happen well in advance of the actual hackathon.</description>

 25% - process notes (10 devlogs, weekly from week 3 onwards) 25% - in-class leadership 40% - API collection (completed before the HeritageJam) 10% - HeritageJam (exact date at end of term to be determined)  The exact balance here can be negotiated, if the work load becomes unreasonable, or if other factors become important (see the section on &amp;lsquo;un|grading&amp;rsquo;). In essence, we&amp;rsquo;re putting on a heritagejam on the theme of &amp;lsquo;the land&amp;rsquo; using data that we are going to put online and we have to learn enough to get it online in a useful way while planning the event.</description>

      <description>COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses.
PLAGIARISM The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include:
 reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source; submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; using another’s data or research findings; failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; handing in &amp;ldquo;substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs.</description>

Trust me. This will be fun!
Previous editions of the HeritageJam are behind the link. From the original HeritageJam site:
What is a &amp;ldquo;Jam&amp;rdquo;? A &amp;ldquo;jam&amp;rdquo; is a short prototyping event which focusses on innovation and creativity around a central theme. Jams have strong roots in the video-game creative practice although increasingly they are being used across academic and other industry areas.</description>
