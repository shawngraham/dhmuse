 25% - process notes (10 devlogs, weekly from week 3 onwards) 25% - in-class leadership 40% - API collection (completed before the HeritageJam) 10% - HeritageJam (exact date at end of term to be determined)  The exact balance here can be negotiated, if the work load becomes unreasonable, or if other factors become important (see the section on &amp;lsquo;un|grading&amp;rsquo;). In essence, we&amp;rsquo;re putting on a heritagejam on the theme of &amp;lsquo;the land&amp;rsquo; using data that we are going to put online and we have to learn enough to get it online in a useful way while planning the event.</description>

I would like to acknowledge that some of this list was put together using the resources collected at La Tanya Autry, et al, “Social Justice &amp;amp; Museums Resource List,” crowdsourced document, Dec 4, google doc.
Also, you might enjoy looking at the materials from the annual Museums and the Web conference here, to round out your interests.
I&amp;rsquo;m not expecting you to read all of this!</description>

      <description>More info about our edition of the HeritageJam will appear here in due course.
Trust me. This will be fun!
Previous editions of the HeritageJam are behind the link. From the original HeritageJam site:
What is a &amp;ldquo;Jam&amp;rdquo;? A &amp;ldquo;jam&amp;rdquo; is a short prototyping event which focusses on innovation and creativity around a central theme. Jams have strong roots in the video-game creative practice although increasingly they are being used across academic and other industry areas.</description>

      <description>blockquote {{% blockquote author=&amp;quot;Carl Jung&amp;quot; %}} Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity. {{% /blockquote %}}   Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.</description>
