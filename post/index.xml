      <description>The point of keeping a running diary-journal-devlog is to have a single point where you can see your evolution over this course. It&amp;rsquo;s a place to tie your readings to the discussions to the hands-on nuts-and-bolts of doing informatics work. It&amp;rsquo;s a place to leave notes to &amp;lsquo;future you&amp;rsquo; so that when you walk away from the machine, you can pick up where you were again.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Tropy</title>
      <link>https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/getting-started-with-tropy/</link>

      <guid>https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/getting-started-with-tropy/</guid>
      <description>Tropy is quite new software meant to help researchers make sense of their research photography. I do not have deep experience with it - yet. But one thing that I am good at (actually, something I quite like to do), is figuring out how to get software, programmes, code working, and getting it to do things that its creators might not necessarily have imagined.
On the other hand, this means that I sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t spell out all of the steps, or I forget which bits of my process are tacit and need to be made explicit when people are starting out.</description>

  What are student hours for? You will be familiar with the idea of &amp;lsquo;office hours&amp;rsquo;, those magical moments where a prof deigns to make themself available by sitting in their cell up along the quiet corridors of the 4th floor of Paterson.</description>

      <title>Notes on Running a Data Hackathon</title>
      <link>https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/notes-on-a-good-hackathon-by-matthew-lincoln/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:36:09 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/notes-on-a-good-hackathon-by-matthew-lincoln/</guid>
      <description>Matthew Lincoln is a research software engineer at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries. He is currently working on a book using data-driven approaches to understanding the art market and collecting histories. You should really keep an eye on his blog if you want to get a look at what&amp;rsquo;s happening today at the intersection of digital techs and the GLAM sector.
On December 17 he published an article, &amp;ldquo;Tips for a Good Hackathon&amp;rdquo; that I think it is worth your while to read, since some of the things that make for a good hackathon happen well in advance of the actual hackathon.</description>

      <description>blockquote {{% blockquote author=&amp;quot;Carl Jung&amp;quot; %}} Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity. {{% /blockquote %}}   Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.</description>
