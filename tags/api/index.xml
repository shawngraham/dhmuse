      <description>You did it!.
  Ave atque Vale I wrote this out and managed to delete everything I had already written. D&amp;rsquo;oh.This is my second try.
Cast your mind back to our first meeting, in January. That day, I had received some bad news concerning the health of a friend of mine. I was pretty flat, and did a poor job in class. I told you about it, later, and said something like, &amp;lsquo;y&amp;rsquo;know, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing we can&amp;rsquo;t roll with in this course, as long as we&amp;rsquo;re talking&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>At this point in the class, you&amp;rsquo;ve started wrestling and wrangling the physical records describing some of the materials in our three partner museums. You&amp;rsquo;re thinking through how to digitize this material - or you should be, make sure to read the relevant how-tos! - and how to organize it into a flat table. You have guidance on how to publish this data online. But&amp;hellip; you might be quietly worried about what one does with such data, once it&amp;rsquo;s online.</description>

      <description>Please note that this course website is equipped with the Hypothes.is annotation layer. If a step is not clear, or there is missing information, or you get stuck, please highlight the relevant text and leave an annotation in our class Hypothesis group to alert me.
  Our end goal - or one of our end goals - is to get the material out of the museum, out of the printed page, and online where someone can query it, filter it, extract items of interest, mash it together with other data, or something else entirely that we haven&amp;rsquo;t thought of yet.</description>
