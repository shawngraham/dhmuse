      <description>The point of keeping a running diary-journal-devlog is to have a single point where you can see your evolution over this course. It&amp;rsquo;s a place to tie your readings to the discussions to the hands-on nuts-and-bolts of doing informatics work. It&amp;rsquo;s a place to leave notes to &amp;lsquo;future you&amp;rsquo; so that when you walk away from the machine, you can pick up where you were again.
It&amp;rsquo;s also a place for you to see what your peers are up to, their successes, and their roadblocks.</description>
