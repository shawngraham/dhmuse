      <description>Matthew Lincoln is a research software engineer at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries. He is currently working on a book using data-driven approaches to understanding the art market and collecting histories. You should really keep an eye on his blog if you want to get a look at what&amp;rsquo;s happening today at the intersection of digital techs and the GLAM sector.
On December 17 he published an article, &amp;ldquo;Tips for a Good Hackathon&amp;rdquo; that I think it is worth your while to read, since some of the things that make for a good hackathon happen well in advance of the actual hackathon.</description>
