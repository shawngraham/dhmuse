      <description>You did it!.
  Ave atque Vale I wrote this out and managed to delete everything I had already written. D&amp;rsquo;oh.This is my second try.
Cast your mind back to our first meeting, in January. That day, I had received some bad news concerning the health of a friend of mine. I was pretty flat, and did a poor job in class. I told you about it, later, and said something like, &amp;lsquo;y&amp;rsquo;know, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing we can&amp;rsquo;t roll with in this course, as long as we&amp;rsquo;re talking&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>So What Can You Do With an API Anyway?</title>

      <description>At this point in the class, you&amp;rsquo;ve started wrestling and wrangling the physical records describing some of the materials in our three partner museums. You&amp;rsquo;re thinking through how to digitize this material - or you should be, make sure to read the relevant how-tos! - and how to organize it into a flat table. You have guidance on how to publish this data online. But&amp;hellip; you might be quietly worried about what one does with such data, once it&amp;rsquo;s online.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Tropy</title>

      <description>Tropy is quite new software meant to help researchers make sense of their research photography. I do not have deep experience with it - yet. But one thing that I am good at (actually, something I quite like to do), is figuring out how to get software, programmes, code working, and getting it to do things that its creators might not necessarily have imagined.
On the other hand, this means that I sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t spell out all of the steps, or I forget which bits of my process are tacit and need to be made explicit when people are starting out.</description>
