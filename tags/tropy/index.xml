      <description>Tropy is quite new software meant to help researchers make sense of their research photography. I do not have deep experience with it - yet. But one thing that I am good at (actually, something I quite like to do), is figuring out how to get software, programmes, code working, and getting it to do things that its creators might not necessarily imagined.
On the other hand, this means that I sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t spell out all of the steps, or I forget which bits of my process are tacit and need to be made explicit when people are starting out.</description>
